'I'll tell you what you show me. You remember You said you knew the place where once, on Kinsman, The early Mormons made a settlement And built a stone baptismal font outdoors- But Smith, or someone, called them off the mountain To go West to a worse fight with the desert. You said you'd seen the stone baptismal font. Well, take me there.'
