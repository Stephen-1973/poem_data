We trod uncomfortably on crunching glass Through a house stripped of everything Except, it seemed, the poetess's poems. Books, I should say!- if books are what is needed. A whole edition in a packing case That, overflowing like a horn of plenty, Or like the poetess's heart of love, Had spilled them near the window, toward the light Where driven rain had wet and swollen them. Enough to stock a village library- Unfortunately all of one kind, though. They bad been brought home from some publisher And taken thus into the family. Boys and bad hunters had known what to do With stone and lead to unprotected glass: Shatter it inward on the unswept floors. How had the tender verse escaped their outrage? By being invisible for what it was, Or else by some remoteness that defied them To find out what to do to hurt a poem. Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book, To send it sailing out the attic window Till it caught wind and, opening out its covers, Tried to improve on sailing like a tile By flying like a bird (silent in flight, But all the burden of its body song), Only to tumble like a stricken bird, And lie in stones and bushes unretrieved. Books were not thrown irreverently about. They simply lay where someone now and then, Having tried one, had dropped it at his feet And left it lying where it fell rejected. Here were all those the poetess's life Had been too short to sell or give away.
