'For God's sake, aren't you fond of viewing nature? You don't like nature. All you like is books. What signify a donkey's cars and bottle, However natural? Give you your books! Well then, right here is where I show you books. Come straight down off this mountain just as fast As we can fall and keep a-bouncing on our feet. It's hell for knees unless done hell-for-leather.'
